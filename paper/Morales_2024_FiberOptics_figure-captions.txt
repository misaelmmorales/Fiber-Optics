Figure Caption List

Figure 1: Schematic of multiphase flow-loop with DFOS unit for experimental data acquisition (for more experimental details see Thiruvenkatanathan et al. [27]).

Figure 2: Visual representation of the multiphase flow rates for each of the 6 trials in the flow-loop experiments. The top row shows the multiphase flow rates in their original units, and the bottom row shows the normalized flow rates.

Figure 3: Relative multiphase flow rate and injection point location for each of the 6 trials in the experiment.

Figure 4: Visualization of the DAS (top), DTS (center) and physical flow properties (bottom) for two trials in the experiment. The left column shows Experiment 45, and the right column shows Experiment 128.

Figure 5: Detailed schematic of the implemented convolutional U-Net AutoEncoder architecture. The original data, $X$, is encoded into a latent representation, $z$, and a mirror Decoder reconstructs the original data into $\hat{X}$. Residual concatenations connect each mirrored hidden layer between the Encoder and Decoder portions of the network.

Figure 6: Schematic of the complete dual latent space model architecture. The DAS AE encodes $X_{DAS}$ into $z_{DAS}$ and decodes to reconstruct $\hat{X}_{DAS}$ (blue). The DTS AE encodes $X_{DTS}$ into $z_{DTS}$ and decodes to reconstruct $\hat{X}_{DTS}$ (green). The two latent spaces, $z_{DAS}$ and $z_{DTS}$, are combined into a dual latent space, $z^*=[z_{DAS}, z_{DTS}]$, which is used to predict the physical flow properties, such that $y=f(z^*)$.

Figure 8: AutoEncoder results for a training realization. The left column shows the results for the DAS U-Net AE, and the right column shows the results for the DTS U-Net AE. The rows are as follows: (top) true, (middle) predicted, and (bottom) absolute error.

Figure 9: True (left) and predicted (right) physical flow properties (relative multiphase flow rate and injection point location) for three test realizations. The top row shows Experiment 45, the middle row shows Experiment 64, and the bottom row Experiment 128.
