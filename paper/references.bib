   abstract = {Fiber optic based distributed acoustic sensors (DAS) provide a new approach for monitoring signals of interest in the subsurface with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution. These sensors produce measurements that are fundamentally different from their traditional counterparts, such as geophones, and produce significantly larger volumes of data. To interpret these data, we begin by using the physics-based thermal-hydraulic-mechanical (THM) model in the GEOS code to simulate synthetic DAS measurements for a range of subsurface conditions (fracture propagation, fault slip, etc.) and sensor configurations (e.g.: horizontal or vertical well deployments). These synthetic DAS measurements are then algorithmically labeled based upon features of interest within their parent models, such as the extent of any generated hydraulic fractures or the distribution of proppant particles, and are compiled into a database. The synthetic database can be used to train and test an initial deep neural network (DNN) representation of the subsurface, which can then be optimized by incorporating any available field measurements through transfer learning. This hybrid, physics informed DNN model is capable of interpreting DAS measurements in near-real time, making it a useful tool for decision making by field engineers, and works under both data-rich and data-poor conditions. To demonstrate this approach, we consider the problem of imaging hydraulic fracture propagation in an unconventional oil and gas reservoir. Our results indicate that we are can use a trained DNN model to accurately estimate the extents of a hydraulic fracture using the location information and DAS measurements for a single fiber-optic sensor as inputs.},

   abstract = {This paper introduces a novel technique that allows real-time injection monitoring with distributed fiber optics using physics-informed machine learning methods and presents results from Clair Ridge asset where a cloud-based, real-time application is deployed. Clair Ridge is a structural high comprising of naturally fractured Devonian to Carboniferous continental sandstones, with a significantly naturally fractured ridge area. The fractured nature of the reservoir lends itself to permanent deployment of Distributed Fiber Optic Sensing (DFOS) to enable real-time injection monitoring to maximise recovery from the field. In addition to their default limitations, such as providing a snapshot measurement and disturbing the natural well flow with up and down flowing passes, wireline-conveyed production logs (PL) are also unable to provide a high-resolution profile of the water injection along the reservoir due to the completion type. DFOS offers unique surveillance capability when permanently installed along the reservoir interface and continuously providing injection profiles with full visibility along the reservoir section without the need for an intervention. The real-time injection monitoring application uses both distributed acoustic and temperature sensing (DAS & DTS) and is based on physics-informed machine learning models. It is now running and available to all asset users on the cloud. So far, the application has generated high-resolution injection profiles over a dozen multi-rate injection periods automatically and the results are cross-checked against the profiles from the warmback analyses that were also generated automatically as part of the same application. The real-time monitoring insights have been effectively applied to provide significant business value using the capability for start-up optimization to manage and improve injection conformance, monitor fractured formations and caprock monitoring.},

   abstract = {Over the last three decades, fiber optic sensors (FOS) have gained a lot of attention for their wide range of monitoring applications across many industries, including aerospace, defense, security, civil engineering, and energy. FOS technologies hold great promise to form the backbone for next-generation intelligent sensing platforms that offer long-distance, high-accuracy, distributed measurement capabilities and multiparametric monitoring with resilience to harsh environmental conditions. The major limitations posed by FOS are 1) cross-sensitivity, 2) enormous volume and large data generation, 3) low data processing speed, 4) degradation of signal-to-noise ratio over the fiber length, and 5) overall cost of sensor and interrogator systems. These challenges can be overcome by building advanced data analytics engines enabled by recent breakthroughs in machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). This article presents a comprehensive review of recent studies that integrate ML and AI algorithms with FOS technologies. This review also highlights several FOS technology development directions that promise a significant impact on widespread use for several industrial applications, with an emphasis on energy systems monitoring. A perspective on future directions for further research development is also provided.},

   abstract = {Predicting gas production from stimulated unconventional reservoirs has always been a challenge to oil and gas companies because the physics of fluid flow through such reservoirs is not well understood. On the other hand, modeling gas production from shale reservoirs is a complex multi-variate problem that requires proper integration of data from multiple disciplines, such as geology, petrophysics, geomechanics, completions, and surface-based measurements, etc. This study demonstrates the application of data-driven machine learning algorithms, integrating geoscientific, distributed acoustic sensing (DAS), distributed temperature sensing (DTS) fiber-optic, completions, flow scanner production log, and surface data to model daily gas production from a 28-stage stimulated horizontal well drilled in the Marcellus Shale of the Appalachian basin in North America. In addition, this study aims to utilize the data from a fiber-optic monitoring system, such as DAS and DTS to evaluate the well performance. We build supervised data-driven machine learning models using Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms to understand the well performance and forecast the daily gas production. The study compares the forecasted results, tests the level of accuracy, and addresses different issues with these machine learning algorithms. A spatio-temporal database is constructed and used to perform sensitivity analyses to identify the key drivers for gas production. The results show that RF and ANN algorithms can be used to predict daily gas production with significantly high accuracy; however, RF algorithm is the best predictor in terms of highest accuracy (96%), less computational time and cost. Based on sensitivity analysis, it appears that Poisson's ratio, minimum horizontal stress, DAS, casing pressure, gamma log are the most important parameters to predict gas production.},

   abstract = {Geologic CO2 sequestration (GCS) has been identified as the most viable option for effectively reducing greenhouse gases emissions to mitigate global warming and worldwide climate change. However, CO2 injection into subsurface can induce reservoir expansion and fault reactivation, which ultimately result in near-surface infrastructure damage and personnel insecurity. Distributed fiber optic sensing (DFOS) technologies function one single fiber as an array of sensors to in-situ monitor multi-parameters, such as geomechanical deformation (i.e., strain), temperature, acoustics and pressure along the entire fiber or cable length. Due to its superiority over conventional geophone and detector, DFOS tool possesses great potential to sense geofluid injection-induced small disturbances in deep subsurface. Here we begin by highlighting recent research efforts in available monitoring tools employed in GCS sites. Given the increasing attentions of optical sensing, we present a first-hand review of DFOS categories, sensing principles, and advantages for GCS related investigations from both laboratory and field scales. We discuss in detail three typical DFOS-deployed GCS projects and explore the implicit findings to guide subsequent GCS field applications. Finally, we summarize the major challenges and going forward in developing, utilizing, and extending DFOS systems to widely apply for the future large-scale all-optical GCS monitoring sites.},

We show that the root-mean-square (RMS) acoustic power is related to flow and density changes in the fluid. However, in practice, fluid parameters are not known at the resolution of the acoustics. In an experimental study, we trained long-short-term memory (LSTM) networks to exploit hidden patterns in an acoustic time series to predict the RMS acoustic power. We found LSTM perform efficiently and shows improvement over baseline neural network predictor, and its strength lies in discriminating sequential order from spatial input data. The system is verified on 25 m resolution fiber-optic acoustic data. Results show promise in predicting anomalous disturbances despite unknown pipe and fluid parameters.},

We designed, trained, and deployed a deep learning model to detect microseismic events in DAS data automatically. We created a curated dataset of nearly 7000 manually selected events and an equal number of background noise examples. We optimized the deep learning model s network architecture together with its training hyperparameters by Bayesian optimization. The trained model achieved an accuracy of 98.6% on our benchmark dataset and even detected low-Amplitude events missed during manual labeling. Our methodology detected more than 100,000 events, allowing for a far more accurate and efficient reconstruction of spatiotemporal fracture development than would have been feasible by traditional methods.},
